These are the steps to use when you are stuck solving a Leetcode problem.

## 1. Visualize the problem by drawing it out

Imagine yourself looking at a whiteboard, utilize diagrams to figure out literally what is going on. Keep track of internal states.

This is especially useful for trees, graphs, matrices, and linked lists.

## 2. Think about how you would solve the problem by hand

Think about solving the problem without writing any code. Usually the hard part is coming up with a code version of the manual approach.
