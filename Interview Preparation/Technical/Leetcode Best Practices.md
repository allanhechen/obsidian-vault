These are the steps to use when you are stuck solving a Leetcode problem.

## 1. Visualize the problem by drawing it out

Imagine yourself looking at a whiteboard, utilize diagrams to figure out literally what is going on. Keep track of internal states.

This is especially useful for trees, graphs, matrices, and linked lists.

## 2. Think about how you would solve the problem by hand

Think about solving the problem without writing any code. Usually the hard part is coming up with a code version of the manual approach.

## 3. Come up with more examples

This is something that can always be done; It helps reinforce understanding of the question, helps identify a question, and prevents prematurely jumping into coding.

## 4. Break up the question into smaller parts

Many times a large question can be broken down into smaller questions with similar parts. Solve the smaller ones before diving into the bigger one.

## 5. Think about how common data structures and algorithms can be used

Literally throw common data structures at the problem, since all Leetcode questions are designed to be solved.

1. Hashmaps: Efficient lookups, most likely will have to be used
2. Graphs: Associations between entities
3. Stack and queue: Parse strings with nested properties
4. Heap: Scheduling and ordering based on some priority (helps find )
