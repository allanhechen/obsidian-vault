## Understanding the question

- Paraphrase and repeat the question back
- Clarify assumptions
	- Does the input have cycles?
	- Can you modify the original data structure?
	- Is the input array sorted?
- Clarify input range
	- Negative values?
	- Floating point values?
	- Null?
	- Duplicates?
	- Extremely large?
- Walk through a simple example

## Working out the problem with the interviewer

The discussion can take around 5-10 minutes depending on the complexity of the problem. You are supposed to discuss the problem before beginning to write any code.

The interviewer may give you hints towards an acceptable solution.

- Try using the [[When You Are Stuck|structured method]] if you get stuck
- Explain a few approaches that one could take to solve the problem, and note down the tradeoffs between each solution
- State and explain the complexity of your proposed approaches

## When coding the question

- Code only after being given the green light
- Explain what you are trying to achieve as you are coding
- Code at a reasonable speed --slow enough to talk, but fast enough to finish the question
- Ask for permission to use trivial functions
- Go from high-level functions and break them down
- State corner cutting out loud and what you would ideally do

## After coding the question

- Check for mistakes
	- Off by one errors
	- Typos
- Brainstorm edge cases and add additional test cases
- Step through code with edge cases
- Explain how the code could be improved
