# Obsidian Vault 📚

Hello! I see you've found your way into my knowledge base for everything Computer Science related. 

The inspiration behind this GitHub repository is as follows:
- 📝 **Documentation of my learning progress**
- 🔍 **Transparency of what I know and what I do not know**
- 🤝 **Helping others with the knowledge I've gathered**

I realize that **note-taking** along with **spaced repetition** is how I learn best, and I believe **Obsidian**, along with the [**spaced repetition extension**](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/obsidian-spaced-repetition-recall), is the way forward for me.

---

## Features I Plan to Include:
- 🧠 Spaced repetition questions to solidify my learning.
- 📂 Clear organization of topics (ex: Nextjs Documentation, Algorithms, Coding Practices).
- 🛠 Practical code snippets for reference.

---

## 🫂 Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!** 🛠  
I understand that I may get some concepts wrong, and if you manage to catch them, I'd really appreciate you opening a **pull request** and discussing my shortcomings.
