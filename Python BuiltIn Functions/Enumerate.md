```python
for (index, item) in enumerate(iterable, start=0):
	# do something with the returned value
```

Functionally equivalent to the following:
```python
def enumerate(iterable, start=0):
	result = []

	for i in iterable:
		result.append()
```

- Takes in an iterable object and pairs it with some numbers

What does the "start" variable represent in enumerate?
