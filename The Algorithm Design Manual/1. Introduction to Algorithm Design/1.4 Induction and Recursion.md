- Induction and recursion are really similar in concept => take a large problem and break it down into smaller problems
- There are formal proofs for induction

What are the subtle errors of an inductive proof? (2)
___
1. Boundary Errors
	Need to take special care for the elements near the borders of our criteria (ex. smallest, largest).
2. Cavalier Extension Claims
	Extra criteria forgotten during the induction proofs may leave to convincing proofs for wrong algorithms.
