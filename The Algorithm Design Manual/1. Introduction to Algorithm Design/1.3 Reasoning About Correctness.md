- Sometimes the best technique to algorithm design is to narrow the set of possible inputs until there is a correct and efficient algorithm.
- Do not use English or pseudocode to whisk away the details of a bad idea to make it sound more plausible
- If the idea of an algorithm is impossible to convey, try using higher-level notation to describe it
