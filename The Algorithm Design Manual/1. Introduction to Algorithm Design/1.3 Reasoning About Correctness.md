- Sometimes the best technique to algorithm design is to narrow the set of possible inputs until there is a correct and efficient algorithm.
- Do not use English or pseudocode to whisk away the details of a bad idea to make it sound more plausible
- If the idea of an algorithm is impossible to convey, try using higher-level notation to describe it

What are the parts of a mathematical proof? (3)
___
1. A clear, precise statement of what is to be proved
2. A set of assumptions
3. A chain of reasoning from the assumptions to the result

What are the parts of problem specifications? (2)
___
1. The allowed inputs
2. The required outputs

What are the traps of specifying algorithm requirements? (2)
___
1. Asking an ill-defined question (ex. find the best route => what is "the best?")
2. Creating compound goals (ex. differing goals that are possible but difficult to solve)

What are the qualities of a good counterexample? (2)
___
1. Verifiability
	Calculate what the answer to the algorithm would be, and show a better result that the algorithm didn't find.
2. Simplicity
	Remove all unnecessary details from it. They make it clear why the proposed algorithm fails.

How to find counterexamples? (5)
___
1. Think small scale
2. Think of the ways the pieces can fit together
3.
